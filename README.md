## Projects
### MARVEL UNIVERSE ANALYSIS IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK	 
- Analyzed a curated dataset of the top 1,000 highest-rated films, applying network analysis and centrality measures to identify above twenty high-impact actors and directors with the strongest influence across cinematic networks. Strong correlation between network centrality and film success, suggesting these individuals could serve as predictive indicators for future box office performance.
